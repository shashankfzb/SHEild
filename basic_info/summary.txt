The SHEild app is a new-age women's safety app that aims to enhance the safety of women
in potentially dangerous situations. It is triggered by an external wearable device such as 
a watch and collects multimodal data from a mobile device, such as audio, even in situations 
where the user may not be able to operate the mobile device. The app uses Solana Blockchain 
technology to securely store user information during registration, and the data is stored 
on a cloud server hosted on Google Cloud Platform. The app includes features such as 
triggering emergency SOS alerts to authorized personnel, identifying nearby police stations 
and app users for help, trusted contacts for notification in emergencies, real-time 
location sharing, and customization settings for user preferences. The app is designed with 
a user-friendly interface using Figma and built using Flutter for cross-platform 
compatibility. The app has the potential to make a tangible impact on women's safety and 
empower them in the modern era.
